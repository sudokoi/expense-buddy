UI Legibility and Theme Enhancements

- _Dynamic Theming_: Fixed Add and History tabs to correctly switch backgrounds between light and dark modes.
- _Improved Contrast_: Replaced hardcoded grays with themed tokens and opacities for better subtext legibility across the app.
- _Button Visibility_: Fixed "Load More" and "Save" button visibility in light mode using theme inversion.
- _Settings UI_: Refined spacing for auto-sync descriptions and improved the visibility of app version information.
- _Code Cleanup_: Removed unused color constants and resolved Tamagui-related TypeScript linting errors.
