Settings UI and changelog improvements.

- Changelog work:
  “What’s New” now pulls the installed version’s entry from CHANGELOG.md (no asset-download boilerplate) and safely skips showing if the changelog is missing/malformed or the version section isn’t found.

- Settings UI improvement:
  - Default payment method section is now collapsible.
  - Reorder theme configuration
